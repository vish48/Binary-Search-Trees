# Binary-Search-Trees
A menu based application to test binary tree and binary search tree functions.

## Project Features
The main pieces of functionality this c++ program offers:
* Create a binary search tree reading from a file.
* Adding a word to the binary search tree.
* Delete a word from the binary search tree.
* Search for a word in the binary search tree.
* Traverse the binary search tree.
* Display what come before a user entered word. 
  * Checks to see if the word is present in the binary search tree first.
* Display what comes after a user entered word.
  * Checks to see if the word is present in the binary search tree first.
* Compares multiple binary search trees that have been created.
* The program should display the following information about the BST:
  * The number of nodes in the tree.
  * The height of the tree.
  * The width of the tree.
  * The weight of the tree.
  * The smallest and biggest word in the tree (alphabetical order).
